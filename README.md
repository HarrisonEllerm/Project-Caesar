# Project-Caesar
A small Rasberry Pi project that makes use of a PIR sensor and camera module to detect and record movement.

Google Drive is used to store the subsequent recordings (through the Google Drive API), and further functionality will be implemented to allow notifications when movement is detected and recorded.

For libraries used see the Pipfile.
